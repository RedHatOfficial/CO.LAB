# CO.LAB

CO.LAB is Red Hat and open source in action. 
CO.LAB teaches students how to work together to solve problems, share new ideas, and to create collaboratively out of a shared experience.

The goal of CO.LAB is to introduce young people to the principles of open source -- and to a world of technology and collaboration that 
they may not have otherwise considered. Collaboration is a powerful driver of innovation and discovery, and open source methodology is 
a key part of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education. Empower your young people with collaborative 
skills that will help them succeed in their pursuit of science, technology, engineering and math careers.

This repository is intended to be a home for the curriculum, materials, and source code that make up our CO.LAB experiences. We invite you 
to collaborate with us to improve, evolve, and grow this initiative.
