# CO.LAB

CO.LAB is Red Hat and open source in action. 
CO.LAB teaches students how to work together to solve problems, share new ideas, and to create collaboratively out of a shared experience.

This repository is intended to be a home for the curriculum, materials, and source code that make up our CO.LAB experiences. We invite you to collaborate with us to improve, evolve, and grow this initiative.
